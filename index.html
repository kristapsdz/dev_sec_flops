				In 2024, how easy is it for a developer to <q>sandbox</q> a program
				by its source code?
			</p>
			<p>
				Assume that the program wants only to manipulate open file
				descriptors (e.g., standard IO) and manage its own
				memory&#8212;regular console stuff.  If the running program tries to
				do anything else, it must be terminated or otherwise unable to
				acquire the requested resources (opening files, network sockets,
				shared memory, etc.).
			</p>
			<p>
				In this article, I examine the many different open source subsystems
				used to enact these sandboxes, such as
				<a href="https://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>'s
				<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge">pledge</a> or
				<a href="https://linux.org">Linux</a>'s
				<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html">seccomp</a>.

				How does they stack up in practice?
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's use
				<a href="https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable">openssh-portable</a>
				as a canonical example.  OpenSSH is under tremendous pressure for
				its security.  It has a number of source code sandboxes, including
				most of those mentioned in this survey.  In general, these sandboxes
				will do little more than our examples&#8212;limit resources used to
				only communication over standard IO and to perform in-process duties
				(memory management, etc.).  How do the lengths of source code (in
				lines) for each sandbox measure, with the collected references
				length for comparison?

				This only shows an instantaneous view of the system: part of the
				security of a system is its maintenance over time.  How difficult is
				it to maintain the security implementations over time?
				In the following chart, I continue looking at 
				<a href="https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable">openssh-portable</a>,
				but extracting its commit history (via GitHub) over time for the
				specific files used for sandboxing.

				Findings so far?  In 2024, security depends on the system you're using.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://linux.org">Linux</a> has a whopping seven-fold
				increase in reference complexity, and even more for source
				complexity, over OpenBSD and FreeBSD.
				<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html">Landlock</a>
				showed promise as a simpler alternative, but has since grown in
				complexity.
				<a href="https://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> and
				<a href="https://freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> rank roughly
				equivalently, with the former having increased mildly in complexity.
			</p>
			<p>
				The maintenance burden for 
				<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html">seccomp</a>,
				as illustrated by 
				<a href="https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable">openssh-portable</a>,
				is considerable.  The burden for the other systems is considerably
				less&#8212;almost nothing since original implementation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ominously, 
				<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos">Mac OS X</a>
				has deprecated its source sandbox, as has
				<a href="https://www.java.com/">Java</a> by discontinuing the 
				<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/security.html">JSM</a>.

				How can we make this better in 2025?
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm starting this site to gain a full picture of the <q>sandbox</q>
				landscape in open systems.  Having a list of possible combinations
				of languages, operating systems, and sandbox tools is a good start.
				And for that, if you have additions, please visit the
				<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/dev_sec_flops">DevSecFlops</a>
				GitHub page to add more examples.
			</p>
			<p>
				More importantly, I want to know
				<strong>who is using these security systems, and where</strong>.
				Let's put together some numbers for how many systems in the wild
				really are protected, and start a conversation about why systems are
				more popular, and what we can do to raise the state of security on
				less-popular systems.
				To wit, I've added <q>attestations</q> to each example in the
				<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/dev_sec_flops">DevSecFlops</a>
				repository.  Just open a pull request with your GitHub name (for
				now, just GitHub&#8212;I'll add more later) and add the repository
				to which you've contributed security sandboxing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Full instructions on how to add examples, subsystems, and
				attestations are all on the GitHub page, and all possible through
				pull requests.  I'll merge this into these on an as-needed basis.
